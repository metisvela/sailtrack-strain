# Strain Calibration

This README provides instructions for calibrating the Strain sensor using the shrouds of a rigged boat using a Python script.

## Prerequisites
* Python installed on your system.
* Both strain_left sand strain_right sensors.
* Access to the shrouds of the rigged boat.

## Calibration Procedure
* Set the right python interpreter with the right dependencies.
* Before proceeding further, it is crucial to allow the sensor to rest without applying any tension. This ensures accurate baseline measurements.
* Run the Python Script: Execute the Python script provided in the repository.
* Follow On-screen Instructions: The script will guide you through the calibration process. Ensure you carefully follow each step as instructed.
* Attach the sensors on both shrouds: Once prompted by the script, attach the tension sensor securely to the shroud of the rigged boat.
